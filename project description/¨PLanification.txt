Month 3-4 Plan (Remaining Work)
Week 1-2: Backend - Equipment & Document Management
Task 1: Equipment Management API Development

Develop endpoints for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving equipment information.

Implement file uploading, deleting, and retrieving documents associated with equipment.

Integrate MongoDB storage for equipment-related data.

Task 2: Document Management and GridFS Integration

Finalize document upload and retrieval process using MongoDB GridFS.

Ensure that documents can be categorized as read-only or read/write, as per user roles.

Implement proper permissions based on roles (Admin, User).

Week 3-4: Backend - User & Authentication Enhancements
Task 3: User Management API Development

Create CRUD operations for user management (add, edit, delete, retrieve users).

Implement role-based access control (RBAC) using Spring Security (Admin, User roles).

Develop the functionality for managing user authentication (sign in/sign up) with JWT tokens.

Task 4: Enhance Authentication Flow

Complete JWT-based authentication flow for all routes.

Improve password hashing and user session management for increased security.

Week 5-6: Frontend - Admin Interface & Equipment Management
Task 5: Admin Dashboard Development

Develop and finalize the admin dashboard with features like adding, editing, and deleting equipment and users.

Integrate equipment details and documents on the dashboard for quick access and management.

Ensure role-based access to the admin panel (only admins should have access).

Task 6: User Profile and Management Pages

Develop user profile management features for Admins to edit employee details.

Integrate functionality for employee data modification and profile viewing.

Week 7-8: Frontend - User Interface & Document Management
Task 7: User Authentication Pages

Develop login, sign-up, and user profile pages for non-admin users.

Ensure role-based access to documents (read-only and read/write).

Develop document viewing pages with clear indication of signed vs. unsigned documents.

Task 8: Document Viewing/Editing Features

Allow users to view documents based on permissions (read-only or read/write).

Implement UI elements for document signing and status indication (e.g., green/red dots for signed documents).

Week 9-10: Backend - Predictive Maintenance Model (AI)
Task 9: Integrate Predictive Maintenance Model

Implement the initial predictive maintenance model using machine learning.

Model should predict equipment failures based on historical data (e.g., MTTR, MTBF, hours of operation, etc.).

Use Scikit-learn or TensorFlow to train the model on available data.

Task 10: Predictive Maintenance API Integration

Develop an API to call predictive maintenance data (e.g., failure predictions, maintenance recommendations).

Integrate predictive results into the admin dashboard to display equipment status (predicted failures, maintenance schedules).

Week 11-12: Frontend - Predictive Maintenance & Chatbot Integration
Task 11: Display Predictive Maintenance Results on Dashboard

Develop UI features to show predictive maintenance results on the admin dashboard.

Create visual elements for showing equipment health status (e.g., predicted failures, upcoming maintenance).

Task 12: AI Chatbot Integration

Integrate the AI chatbot into the web application using Rasa or LangChain API.

Ensure the chatbot can handle basic queries related to equipment (e.g., “Which equipment is most repaired?” or “Show me the machines in the cutting zone”).

Train the chatbot to respond with relevant data from the database.

Week 13-14: Backend - Chatbot and Final Enhancements
Task 13: Chatbot Backend Integration

Set up endpoints to support the chatbot’s backend (queries related to equipment, status, maintenance).

Integrate chatbot with MongoDB for dynamic data fetching based on user queries.

Task 14: Final Bug Fixes and Feature Refinement

Perform integration testing for backend APIs and frontend interfaces.

Resolve any issues related to document uploads, user access, predictive maintenance API, and chatbot functionality.

Week 15-16: Testing, Optimization & Deployment
Task 15: Comprehensive Testing (Unit, Integration, UI)

Conduct extensive testing of backend endpoints (CRUD, JWT authentication, document management, etc.).

Perform UI testing to ensure user experience (UX) is smooth and all functionalities are working as expected.

Ensure the chatbot responds accurately and dynamically.

Task 16: Deployment and Documentation

Deploy the application to a staging or production environment.

Prepare detailed documentation (both technical and user-facing) for the system, covering installation, usage, and API documentation.
