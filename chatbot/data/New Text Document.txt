in my prediction projet in need to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of an equipment using my current dataset she maybe need to add some columns for the prediction and here also little information about the data set : "equipment status  is calculated by an expression  that use some other critiere columns(IF(S477<=0.2,"Excellent",IF(AND(S477>0.2,S477<=0.4),"Bon",IF(AND(S477>0.4,S477<=0.6),"Moyen",IF(AND(S477>0.6,S477<=0.8),"Alarmant",IF(AND(S477>0.8),"Besoin Upgrade"))))) )  and knowing that the  maintenance_mttr_mtbf  is mttr equal to main time to repair and the mtbf equal to main time between failaire  and equipment_commercialized mean if the equipment still available  in market and pdr_commercialized means the pdr is piece de rechange if still available in market  and the replacement_parts means if this equipment have piece de rechange or no  and the aging_result column is a calculated column  and also we have age and year we only going two use the year column and we have the degrability is also calculated and from the age column IF(L477<=6,0,IF(AND(L477>6,L477<=14),0.4,IF(AND(L477>14,L477<=20),0.7,1)))  also the column technologie is same as equipment_commercialized so we only use the equipment_commercialized and the column aging result also use expression : (M477*0.6)+(O477*0.1)+(P477*0.2)+(Q477*0.05)+(R477*0.05)   " thats all u have to know abt the dataset and   here example of some lignes in my dataset :
