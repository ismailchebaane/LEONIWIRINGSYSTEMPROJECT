	\section{Context of the Project}
	
	This project was carried out as part of an end-of-studies internship at \textbf{LEONI Wiring Systems}, a multinational company specialized in manufacturing automotive wiring harnesses. It was initiated to address the growing industrial need for a modern, intelligent, and user-friendly digital platform.  
	
	The solution aims to centralize equipment management, digitize technical documentation, and integrate an AI-powered chatbot for instant, context-aware assistance. It also includes a predictive model to estimate the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of equipment, enabling proactive and optimized maintenance planning. The work was developed in close collaboration with the maintenance, production, and IT departments to ensure that it meets real operational requirements and improves overall efficiency.
	
	\section{Problem Statement}
	
	In many industrial environments, equipment management and technical documentation are handled through fragmented systems or manual processes. This often results in difficulties accessing critical information, delays in decision-making, and inefficiencies in maintenance planning.  
	
	At LEONI Wiring Systems, these challenges are further amplified by the need to maintain a large fleet of equipment while ensuring minimal downtime and strict compliance with production schedules. The absence of a unified platform integrating equipment tracking, document digitization, and predictive maintenance tools leads to operational gaps and increased maintenance costs.  
	
	
	\section{Project Objectives}
	
	The primary objective of this project is to design and develop an intelligent web application that addresses the identified industrial challenges. Specifically, the platform aims to:  
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Centralize equipment data and technical documentation in a unified digital environment.
		\item Integrate an AI-powered chatbot for instant and accurate assistance related to equipment and maintenance procedures.
		\item Implement a predictive model to estimate the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of equipment, enabling proactive maintenance planning.
		\item Enhance operational efficiency, reduce downtime, and support data-driven decision-making.  
	\end{itemize}

	\end{itemize}
	
	This solution addresses the limitations of existing platforms by combining advanced AI capabilities with industry-specific functionality, cost efficiency, and simplified deployment and maintenance.

	\chapter{Needs Analysis and Design}
	
	\section{Introduction}
	
	
	This chapter focuses on the needs analysis and design of the platform. It identifies the main actors—users, administrators, and the AI Chatbot—and their roles and interactions. Functional and non-functional requirements are detailed to ensure the system meets performance, usability, and security standards. The chapter also presents workflows, UML diagrams (use case, class, and sequence), and a data dictionary to clearly define system behavior, structure, and data attributes. This analysis provides a solid foundation for system implementation.
	
	\section{Identification of Actors}
	
	The system involves three main actors:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{User:}  
		The end-user can:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Navigate and search for equipment information.
			\item View dashboards displaying relevant metrics and statistics.
			\item Download or sign documents.
			\item Access the prediction module to estimate equipment Remaining Useful Life (RUL).
			\item Interact with the chatbot for equipment-related inquiries.
		\end{itemize}
		
		\item \textbf{Admin:}  
		The administrator has all the user capabilities plus additional management features:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Manage user accounts (add, remove, update).
			\item Manage equipment records (add, remove, update).
			\item Upload, associate, and manage documents linked to equipment.
			\item Access notifications when users have more than 10 unsigned documents.
			\item Use the prediction module and chatbot.
		\end{itemize}
		
		\item \textbf{AI Chatbot:}  
		An intelligent assistant integrated into the platform that:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Answers questions using a CSV database containing equipment information.
			\item Supports multiple languages for diverse user needs.
			\item Can generate and return diagrams when relevant.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	
	\section{Identification of Requirements}
	
	\subsection{Functional Requirements}
	
	The functional requirements of the system are as follows:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Equipment Management:} Ability to add, update, delete, and view equipment data.
		\item \textbf{Document Management:} Upload, view, sign, and track documents linked to equipment.
		\item \textbf{User Management (Admin only):} Create, update, and remove user accounts.
		\item \textbf{Dashboard Visualization:} Display statistics, KPIs, and monitoring charts.
		\item \textbf{Prediction Module:} Estimate the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of equipment.
		\item \textbf{Notifications:} Alert admin when users have more than 10 unsigned documents.
		\item \textbf{Chatbot Interaction:} Provide answers, multilingual support, and diagrams from CSV data.
	\end{itemize}
	
	
	
	
	
	
	\subsection{Non-Functional Requirements}
	
	The non-functional requirements include:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Performance:} The system should respond to user actions in less than 2 seconds on average.
		\item \textbf{Scalability:} Support simultaneous access by multiple users without performance degradation.
		\item \textbf{Security:} Ensure secure authentication and protect sensitive data.
		\item \textbf{Usability:} Provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface for both users and admins.
		
		\item \textbf{Compatibility:} Accessible via major web browsers and mobile devices.
		\item \textbf{Multilingual Support:} The chatbot and UI must handle multiple languages seamlessly.
	\end{itemize}
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	\section{Chatbot Operation Workflow}
	
	The chatbot is a key feature of the platform, enabling intelligent, multilingual interaction with users. Its operation is structured as follows:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Data Loading:}  
		The chatbot uses a CSV file (\texttt{latest\_dataset.csv}) containing updated equipment data. This file is loaded into a Pandas \texttt{DataFrame} when the application starts.
		
		\item \textbf{Request Handling:}  
		When a user submits a question via the interface, it is sent as a JSON request to the Flask backend through the \texttt{/chat} API endpoint.
		
		\item \textbf{Custom Prompt Generation:}  
		The backend creates a structured prompt containing:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The user’s question.
			\item The DataFrame columns.
			\item Instructions to return Python code for analysis or visualization only.
		\end{itemize}
		
		\item \textbf{Language Model Processing:}  
		The prompt is processed by a large language model through the Groq API. The model generates code to answer the query or create diagrams.
		
		\item \textbf{Execution and Diagram Generation:}  
		Using the PandasAI \texttt{SmartDataframe}, the generated code is executed. If a chart is created, it is saved in the \texttt{exports/charts} directory.
		
		\item \textbf{Response Delivery:}  
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Text results are returned directly to the user.
			\item Image results return a URL to the generated diagram.
		\end{itemize}
		
		\item \textbf{Multilingual Support:}  
		The model supports multiple languages, allowing users to interact in their preferred language without retraining the chatbot.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	This design allows the chatbot to adapt dynamically to updated CSV data without the need for retraining, ensuring continuous relevance and accuracy.

	\chapter{Implementation of the Solution and Analysis}
	
	
	
	\section{Introduction}
	
	\section{Introduction}
	This chapter presents the practical implementation of the proposed solution. It begins by describing the hardware and software environment that supported development, including the main programming tools, frameworks, and libraries used. Next, it highlights the key interfaces of the platform through screenshots, with particular emphasis on the analytical dashboards and data science components that demonstrate the system’s predictive capabilities.
	
	
	\section{Intelligent Chatbot Model}
	
	The intelligent chatbot model developed in this project enables users to ask questions in natural language about a dataset in CSV format and receive accurate answers derived directly from the data.  
	
	The chatbot’s architecture combines a large language model (LLM) with specialized tools that interpret user queries, execute computations on the dataset, and return results in a readable format (text or charts).  
	
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/chatbot_model.png}
		\caption{Architecture of the intelligent chatbot developed for tabular data analysis}
		\label{fig:chatbot_model}
	\end{figure}
	
	
	
	
	
	\section{Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)}
	
	Another approach explored was \textit{Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)}, which combines text generation by the LLM with retrieval of relevant data from external sources (in this case, a CSV file).  
	
	The RAG pipeline in our context followed these steps:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Generate embeddings for each row of the dataset,
		\item Search for the rows most semantically similar to the user’s question,
		\item Enrich the LLM’s response with the retrieved rows.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	Although promising, this approach performed poorly on structured tabular data. Embedding-based similarity search worked better on textual documents (such as PDFs) but struggled with numeric and categorical values.  
	
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{figures/rag.png}
		\caption{Principle of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)}
		\label{fig:rag}
	\end{figure}
	
	\section{Chatbot Tools}
	\subsection{General Chat Tool}
	
	The \textit{General Chat} tool was designed to handle general or simple queries that did not require advanced search. For example, it could explain the meaning of a column, describe the overall content of the dataset, or provide basic insights.  
	
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{figures/general_chat.png}
		\caption{Workflow of the General Chat tool}
		\label{fig:general_chat}
	\end{figure}
	
	\subsection{Vector Search Tool}
	
	The \textit{Vector Search} tool aimed to find dataset rows that were semantically closest to the user’s question. The process involved:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Converting dataset rows into embeddings using a SentenceTransformer model,
		\item Performing cosine similarity search to retrieve the most relevant rows,
		\item Returning these rows as candidate answers.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	Despite being theoretically useful, this method was not effective on tabular data. The retrieved rows often lacked precision and did not match user expectations.  
	
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{figures/vector_search.png}
		\caption{Vector Search mechanism applied to the dataset}
		\label{fig:vector_search}
	\end{figure}
	
	\section{Initial Experiments}
	
	In addition to the above tools, multiple \textbf{fine-tuning experiments} were conducted with different LLMs, including Llama-2, Mistral, Phi, and TinyLlama.  
	
	Fine-tuning was attempted using the PEFT framework (LoRA) on limited hardware (GTX 950M GPU with 2GB VRAM and Intel i7 CPU). The main challenges encountered were:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Very long training times, especially with larger models such as Llama-2,
		\item Training failures due to insufficient GPU memory,
		\item Poor response accuracy with smaller models such as TinyLlama.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/finetune_results.png}
		\caption{Example of poor responses obtained after TinyLlama fine-tuning}
		\label{fig:finetune}
	\end{figure}
	
	These results demonstrated the impracticality of fine-tuning on limited local hardware.
	\section{Final Adopted Solution} 
	
	After evaluating several unsuccessful approaches, the final adopted solution was based on the \textbf{Llama-3.3-70B-Versatile} model accessed through the Groq API.  
	
	This approach leverages the \texttt{pandas-ai} library and its \texttt{SmartDataframe} component, which allows natural language interaction with tabular datasets. The system dynamically generates Python code to answer user queries and executes it directly on the dataset.  
	
	The main advantages of this solution are:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item High accuracy and responsiveness thanks to Groq’s optimized inference,
		\item Automatic code generation for numeric and statistical queries,
		\item Support for visualization with charts saved locally,
		\item Minimal local hardware requirements, since heavy computation is outsourced to the API.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/final_architecture.png}
		\caption{Final architecture of the chatbot using Llama-3.3-70B with SmartDataframe}
		\label{fig:final_arch}
	\end{figure}
	
	\section{Groq API Integration} 
	
	The Groq API was chosen as the inference backend because of its extremely low latency and cost-efficient execution of large-scale LLMs. By outsourcing heavy computation to Groq’s infrastructure, the system can deliver near real-time responses without requiring powerful local GPUs. This significantly reduces deployment complexity while ensuring high throughput and scalability.  
	
	\section{Use of Pandas-AI and SmartDataframe} 
	
	The integration of the \texttt{pandas-ai} library with its \texttt{SmartDataframe} object represents a core innovation of this solution. The \texttt{SmartDataframe} acts as a natural language interface to structured tabular datasets. When the user submits a query, the system:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Maps the query to dataset columns using contextual embeddings,
		\item Generates Python code via Llama-3.3-70B,
		\item Executes the code securely on the dataset,
		\item Returns results in textual or graphical form. 
	\end{enumerate}
	
	This approach bridges the gap between natural language processing and data analytics, allowing non-technical users to perform advanced queries without explicit programming.  
	
	\section{Architecture and Workflow of the Final Chatbot}
	
	The final chatbot workflow can be summarized as follows:
	\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep, topsep=0pt]
		\item The user submits a natural language query through the web interface,
		\item The query is embedded into a custom prompt including dataset column names,
		\item The LLM (Llama-3.3-70B-Versatile on Groq) generates the corresponding Python code,
		\item The code is executed on the dataset via \texttt{SmartDataframe},
		\item The results are displayed as text or charts on the interface.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/workflow.png}
		\caption{Overall workflow of the final chatbot system}
		\label{fig:workflow}
	\end{figure}
	
	
	
	
	\section{Data Preparation}
	
	\subsection{Data Cleaning and Transformation}
	The initial dataset was provided in a CSV format containing heterogeneous information about industrial equipment. In order to ensure the quality and consistency of the data, several preprocessing steps were performed:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Normalization of column names}: removal of special characters and conversion to lowercase.
		\item \textbf{Removal of irrelevant columns}: such as \texttt{technical\_id}, \texttt{equipment\_name}, and \texttt{physical\_status}.
		\item \textbf{Encoding of categorical variables}: columns such as \texttt{plant}, \texttt{process}, \texttt{master\_data\_name}, and \texttt{location} were transformed into numerical values using \texttt{LabelEncoder}.
		\item \textbf{Boolean conversion}: attributes \texttt{equipment\_commercialized} and \texttt{pdr\_commercialized}, originally encoded as \textit{OUI/NON}, were transformed into binary values (\texttt{True/False}).
		\item \textbf{Handling missing values}: artificial values were generated for unique identifiers (\texttt{serial\_number}, \texttt{immobilization\_number}), and default values were assigned for missing years or technical attributes.
		\item \textbf{Derived calculations}: the \texttt{age} column was computed from the acquisition year, and the attribute \texttt{aging\_result} was estimated using a weighted combination of factors such as degradability, spare parts, and production hours.
		\item \textbf{Target definition}: the target variable was defined as the \textbf{RUL (Remaining Useful Life)}, corresponding to the estimated residual lifetime of a piece of equipment.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{Feature Selection}
	After cleaning, the features selected for model training are defined in the \texttt{config.py} file:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Categorical variables: \texttt{plant}, \texttt{process}, \texttt{master\_data\_name}, \texttt{location}.
		\item Numerical variables: \texttt{year}, \texttt{equipment\_commercialized}, \texttt{pdr\_commercialized}, \texttt{production\_hours}, \texttt{replacement\_parts}, \texttt{maintenance\_mttr\_mtbf}.
	\end{itemize}
	
	These features capture both structural aspects (location, type of process) and operational aspects (production, maintenance) of the equipment.
	
	\section{Evaluation of Prediction Models}
	
	In order to identify the most suitable model, several regression algorithms were trained and compared.  
	
	\subsection{Linear Regression}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $R^{2}_{train} = 0.710$, $R^{2}_{test} = 0.725$
		\item MAE = 2.44, RMSE = 3.25
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{Ridge Regression}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $R^{2}_{train} = 0.709$, $R^{2}_{test} = 0.725$
		\item MAE = 2.43, RMSE = 3.26
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{Random Forest}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $R^{2}_{train} = 0.947$, $R^{2}_{test} = 0.867$
		\item MAE = 1.63, RMSE = 2.26
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{Gradient Boosting}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $R^{2}_{train} = 0.911$, $R^{2}_{test} = 0.889$
		\item MAE = 1.52, RMSE = 2.06
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{XGBoost}
	The XGBoost model, trained with hyperparameter tuning, achieved the following performance:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $R^{2}_{train} = 0.911$, $R^{2}_{test} = 0.890$
		\item MAE = 1.51, RMSE = 2.05
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{Model Comparison}
	\begin{table}[H]
		\centering
		\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|}
			\hline
			\textbf{Model} & \textbf{R² Train} & \textbf{R² Test} & \textbf{MAE} & \textbf{RMSE} \\
			\hline
			Linear Regression & 0.710 & 0.725 & 2.44 & 3.25 \\
			Ridge Regression  & 0.709 & 0.725 & 2.43 & 3.26 \\
			Random Forest     & 0.947 & 0.867 & 1.63 & 2.26 \\
			Gradient Boosting & 0.911 & 0.889 & 1.52 & 2.06 \\
			XGBoost           & 0.911 & 0.890 & 1.51 & 2.05 \\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
		\caption{Comparison of the performance of different RUL prediction models}
		\label{tab:model-comparison}
	\end{table}
	
	Based on Table \ref{tab:model-comparison}, the \textbf{XGBoost} model achieved the best overall performance, slightly outperforming Gradient Boosting and Random Forest in terms of generalization and error metrics. Therefore, XGBoost was selected as the final predictive model for Remaining Useful Life (RUL).

	\section{Deployment and Prediction}
	
	Once the model was trained and saved, an API was developed using \texttt{Flask} to integrate the predictive system into an external application. The file \texttt{main.py} exposes a REST endpoint \texttt{/predict} that takes as input the features of a piece of equipment and returns the predicted RUL value.
	
	This approach facilitates the practical use of the model within a software solution or a monitoring dashboard for industrial equipment.
	
	
	
	
	\section{Conclusion}
	
	This chapter presented the implementation of the intelligent chatbot and predictive maintenance system. Several approaches, such as retrieval-augmented generation and fine-tuning, were tested but showed limitations on structured industrial datasets. The final solution, based on the Llama-3.3-70B model with \texttt{SmartDataframe}, proved to be the most effective, delivering accurate insights with minimal local resources.  
	
	For predictive maintenance, regression models were compared, and XGBoost achieved the best performance for Remaining Useful Life estimation. The results were validated through visualizations and deployed via a Flask-based API for practical use.  
	
	In summary, the system successfully combined generative AI with classical machine learning, offering a scalable and reliable solution for industrial data analysis.

	\section{Conclusion}
	In this chapter, we detailed the implementation of the platform, from the development environment to the final deployed solution. The integration of modern frameworks such as React, Spring Boot, and MongoDB ensured a scalable web infrastructure, while Python libraries like XGBoost, Pandas, and Transformers provided robust support for machine learning and data analysis.  
	
	The different interfaces were illustrated, showing how users can interact with the system—from equipment management to predictive dashboards. Overall, the implementation confirms that the platform successfully combines web technologies and artificial intelligence to deliver a functional and efficient solution for industrial data management and predictive maintenance.
